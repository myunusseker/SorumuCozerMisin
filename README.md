Micro volunteering is an increasingly common concept around the world that a volunteer or a group of volunteers conduct
social services over a small period of time via a computer or smartphone over the 
Internet. 

With the mobile application we have developed, we bring together students
with knowledgeable and educated people on the same platform.

Simply open up the app, select your role, and start sharing/answering questions.

For the beta phase, teacher role is only for users having an invitation.
